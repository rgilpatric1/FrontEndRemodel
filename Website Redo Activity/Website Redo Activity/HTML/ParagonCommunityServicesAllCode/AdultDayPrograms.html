                    Individuals who would benefit from enhanced awareness of their environment and interaction with their surroundings are encouraged to participate in our sensory integration program. The program focuses on exploration of sensory experiences such as visual (sight), tactile (touch), vestibular (movement, swinging), auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), proprioreceptive (position changes) and gustatory (taste).

                    Individuals with socialization needs spend quality time together, allowing for friendships to develop outside of home life. These opportunities can improve quality of life, assist with skill development, and foster new relationships. Participants have varied opportunities for off-site community activities.
