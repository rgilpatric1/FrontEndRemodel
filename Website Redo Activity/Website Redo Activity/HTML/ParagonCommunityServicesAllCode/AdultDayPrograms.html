                    Individuals who have suffered brain injury are encouraged to engage in social interaction, daily living activities, and skill building. 
                    Several members of our management staff have received their AACBIS* certification.

                    *The Academy of Certified Brain Injury Specialists (ACBIS) offers a voluntary national certification program for both entry-level

                    Individuals who would benefit from enhanced awareness of their environment and interaction with their surroundings are encouraged 
                    to participate in our sensory integration program. The program focuses on exploration of sensory experiences such as visual (sight), 
                    tactile (touch), vestibular (movement, swinging), auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), proprioreceptive (position changes) and 
                    gustatory (taste).

                    Individuals with socialization needs spend quality time together, allowing for friendships to develop outside of home life. 
                    These opportunities can improve quality of life, assist with skill development, and foster new relationships. Participants have 
                    varied opportunities for off-site community activities.
