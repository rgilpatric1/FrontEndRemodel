            During the COVID-19 outbreak, Paragon Community Services (PCS) – a MyPath Company – has suspended its operations. 
            Our PCS team, however, continues to support those we serve, and each other.  Here’s how we’re working together
            amid the challenges of COVID-19:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    PCS Participants who are also served by Homes for Independent Living (HIL), another MyPath Company, 
                    are being cared for in
                    their HIL home. In some cases, this care is being provided by staff who supported them at PCS 
                    day services, enhancing continuity of care for these participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PCS personnel also have been offered continuing work opportunities 
                    in other MyPath Company settings during this period of PCS program closure.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For almost 30 years, Paragon Community Services has been providing day services for adults
            and children with disabilities. During that time our goal has remained steadfast—to provide greater independence 
            and improve the lives of the people we serve. We strive to maximize personal growth, self-esteem, and happiness
            in every participant.
            <br />

            At Paragon, we understand that each individual is unique, which is why we tailor our programs
            to the personalized needs of each participant. We believe the most effective programs and therapies
            are dynamic and that a caring touch helps to ensure our participants achieve their highest degree of potential. 
            From the moment you walk in, you’ll know that our staff, made up of dedicated professionals, love what they do.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our participants and their families appreciate the comfortable, home-like atmosphere of our various locations. 
            Loved ones enjoy a wealth of activities, community outings and socialization yet are supervised in a safe and
            protective setting. And caregivers feel good about getting some much needed time for work or to care for themselves.
            <br />
            <br />
            We’re confident we have a program to suit your schedule, lifestyle, and unique needs, with many options to 
            choose from. We also provide assistance and support with health and personal care needs as required.
